# TSLA_Stock-prediction
This project implements a machine learningâ€“based trading agent that predicts Tesla's stock price movements and makes simulated trading decisions. The system uses historical data from Yahoo Finance, computes technical indicators, trains an XGBoost regression model, and then applies a decision logic to buy, sell, or hold based on predicted percentage changes.
